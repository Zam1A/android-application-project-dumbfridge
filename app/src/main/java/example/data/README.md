# JUnit5 Tests for project template

This branch contains the `example.data` package with the following classes:

- `DBConnection.java`
- `InvalidUserException.java`
- `StaticDatabaseConnection.java`
- `StaticUserDAO.java`
- `User.java`
- `UserDAO.java`

These classes mocks the behaviour of a database connection and a user DAO by using a static ArrayList of users as a database.

The tests for these classes can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/QUT-CAB302-Software-Development/share-files/archive/junit-data-tests.zip).
